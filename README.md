# Python-Chat
In this Python chat you'll find four codes. The first two represent a client and a server that are talking (it's a simple example of chat in which server is talking).
In second part we've to imagine a server that can connect more clients.
I ran these codes using Command Propt, opened from Thonny.
Feel free to use it!
